I am a Product Designer from Berlin constantly driven by the question how computers of the future could be designed to empower users by increasing the control over software and personal data.
Open source, encryption, local first and interoperability are some of the technologies I strongly believe in to provide data sovereignty, transparency and privacy for individuals and all sorts of organizations.
I want to design new concepts for human-computer interactions that break the traditional idea of siloed apps into malleable software â€” an adaptable environment that can represent information in different modes and perspectives to increase productivity and creative freedom, to support individuals and teams with knowledge management and collaboration.
