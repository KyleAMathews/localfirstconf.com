I’m working to improve computers in service of human creativity and prosperity.

I cofounded Muse (canvas for thinking), Ink & Switch (industrial research lab), and Heroku (web app deployment).

I design products, build teams, write, podcast, and occasionally invest. I’m from California but have settled in Berlin.
